    <p><h2>Pelmeni are Russian meat-filled dumplings</h2></p>
    <h3>ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>Â¾ cup warm water, or more as needed</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour for dusting</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Directions</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make dough: Combine egg, oil, and salt in a liquid measuring cup; add enough warm water to fill to 1 cup. Pour into a large bowl and knead in 3 cups flour until smooth and elastic. Cover with a dish towel and let dough rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make filling: Combine ground beef, onion, water, salt, and pepper in a medium bowl; mix thoroughly by hand or using a fork. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Dust a baking sheet lightly with 1 tablespoon flour; set aside.</li>
        <li>Roll out a portion of dough very thinly on a lightly floured surface; keep remaining dough covered with a dish towel to avoid drying out. Cut out 2 1/2-inch rounds with a cookie cutter. Place about 1 teaspoon filling on one side of each dough circle. Fold dough over and seal the edges using your fingers, forming a crescent. Join the ends and pinch them together. Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Freeze pelmeni for 30 minutes to prevent them from sticking together.

        </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a simmer. Working in batches, cook frozen pelmeni in simmering water until meat is cooked through and pelmeni float to the top, about 5 minutes. Continue cooking for 5 more minutes. Transfer to serving plates using a slotted spoon.</li>
